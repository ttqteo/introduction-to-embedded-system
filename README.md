# Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments

## Week 1
### Learning Objective
1. Define the components of an embedded system
2. Classify the parts of an embedded systems developer’s Source Configuration Management (SCM)
3. Apply Git Version Control to software projects
4. Write a simple programming assignment that prints statistics to the command line using a variety of c-programming operators and features.
5. Perform Compilation with GCC and execute output files from the command line.
6. Use git Version control to create a repository to version control code.

## Week 2
### Learning Objective
1. Implement a build system using GNU’s Make and GCC compiler toolsets
2. Examine the pre-processor's role in compilation
3. Integrate new libraries to a build system
4. Write a makefile that can natively and cross compile an application
5. Generate preprocessor, assembly, object, dependency, executable, and map output files

## Week 3
### Learning Objective
1. Analyze the components of a program’s memory space for both code and data regions
2. Write C-programs to define data in different memory regions
3. Interpret application’s map and linker files
4. Use GCC Binary Utilities to investigate the memory usage of an executable
5. Investigate the map file for the memory usage of an executable
6. Determine where compiled code and data symbols are allocated, the lifetime of these symbols and the access restrictions

## Week 4
### Learning Objective
1. Write C-Program function that manipulate memory.
2. Evaluate your application by simulating it on the host machine
3. Incorporate a C-Program application into your Make and GCC build system
